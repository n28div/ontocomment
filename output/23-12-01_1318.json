ERAD pathways target misfolded ER lumenal proteins (ERAD-L), ER membrane proteins (ERAD-M) and ER proteins with misfolded cytosolic domains (ERAD-C) by recognizing aberrant proteins, retrotranslocating these substrates to the cytosol, followed by subsequent substrate ubiquitination and proteosome-mediated degradation. In contrast the SHRED pathway, although inducible by stress, targets diverse ER membrane and cytosolic proteins as well as numerous other native proteins in the absence of stress. In the SHRED pathway an Nma111p serine protease-mediated cleavage results in the generation of a Roq1p fragment that then binds to the type-1 active site of Ubr1p, altering its substrate specificity, and leading to the proteasome-mediated degradation of both misfolded and native proteins. SHRED is also considered to be distinct from the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (GO:0030968), a process by which ER stress activates the ER membrane protein Ire1p, resulting in splicing of the HAC1 mRNA, followed by Hac1p-mediated up-regulation of UPR genes. Induction of SHRED does not require IRE1 or HAC1, and as such is currently considered to be distinct.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": [], "is range of": [], "subclass of": ["GO_0043161", "GO_0033554", "GO_0010243"], "superclass of": []}, "label": ""}]}, "output": "---\n\nThis is a simple class in Python that demonstrates how to use the `print()` function to print a message to the console."}, {"data": {"target": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0052109", "target_description": {"comment": "This term was obsoleted because it is a host, not a symbiont process, but was formulated as a symbiont process.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": [], "is range of": [], "subclass of": [], "superclass of": []}, "label": ""}, "references": ["http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0005846", "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0030508", "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0001724"], "references_description": [{"comment": "Note that this complex can be found in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": [], "is range of": [], "subclass of": ["GO_0034518"], "superclass of": []}, "label": ""}, {"comment": "This term was made obsolete because it represents a combination of gene product features and involvement in a biological process.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": [], "is range of": [], "subclass of": [], "superclass of": []}, "label": ""}, {"comment": "This term was made obsolete because it represents a single gene product and not a complex.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": [], "is range of": [], "subclass of": [], "superclass of": []}, "label": ""}]}, "output": "// \u8fd9\u91cc\u53ef\u4ee5\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e9b\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7c7b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u7528\u9014\n    // \u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7c7b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u4e00\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\n    // \u6216\u8005\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7c7b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\n    // \u8fd9\u4e9b\u6ce8\u91ca\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7c7b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u7528\u9014\n\n    // \u8fd9\u91cc\u53ef\u4ee5\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7801\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6f14\u793a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7c7b"}, {"data": {"target": "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_1900051", "target_description": {"comment": "This term was obsoleted because it represents a molecular function.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": [], "is range of": [], "subclass of": [], "superclass of": []}, "label": ""}, "references": ["http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0004182", "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0036288", "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0030067"], "references_description": [{"comment": "This term was made obsolete because it represents a gene product.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": [], "is range of": [], "subclass of": [], "superclass of": []}, "label": ""}, {"comment": "Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct manual annotation of gene products.
