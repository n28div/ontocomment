ERAD pathways target misfolded ER lumenal proteins (ERAD-L), ER membrane proteins (ERAD-M) and ER proteins with misfolded cytosolic domains (ERAD-C) by recognizing aberrant proteins, retrotranslocating these substrates to the cytosol, followed by subsequent substrate ubiquitination and proteosome-mediated degradation. In contrast the SHRED pathway, although inducible by stress, targets diverse ER membrane and cytosolic proteins as well as numerous other native proteins in the absence of stress. In the SHRED pathway an Nma111p serine protease-mediated cleavage results in the generation of a Roq1p fragment that then binds to the type-1 active site of Ubr1p, altering its substrate specificity, and leading to the proteasome-mediated degradation of both misfolded and native proteins. SHRED is also considered to be distinct from the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (GO:0030968), a process by which ER stress activates the ER membrane protein Ire1p, resulting in splicing of the HAC1 mRNA, followed by Hac1p-mediated up-regulation of UPR genes.
