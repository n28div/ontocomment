These distinctions allow to represent two different notions of 'semantics': the first one is abstract and formal ('formal semantics'), and formallyInterprets symbols that are about entities whatsoever; for example, the term 'Quark' isAbout the Collection of all quarks, and that Collection isFormalGroundingFor the abstract class 'Quark' (in the extensional sense).  The second notion is social, localized in space-time ('social semantics'), and can be used to interpret entities in the intensional sense. For example, the Collection of all quarks isCoveredBy the Concept 'Quark', which is also expressed by the term 'Quark'.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": [], "is range of": [], "subclass of": ["Abstract"], "superclass of": ["Formal entity"]}, "label": "Formal entity"}]}, "output": "rdfs:domain: \nrdfs:range: \nrdfs:comment: \nrdfs:domain: \nrdfs:range: \nrdfs:domain: \nrdfs:range: \nrdfs:domain: \nrdfs:domain: \nrdfs:domain: \nrdfs:domain: \nrdfs:domain: \nrdfs:domain: \nrdfs:domain: \nrd", "metrics": {"rouge1": 0.0, "rouge2": 0.0, "rougeL": 0.0, "rougeLsum": 0.0, "meteor": 0.0, "bertscore_precision": 0.69942307472229, "bertscore_recall": 0.8080177307128906, "bertscore_f1": 0.7498089075088501, "chrf": 10.555150481466734, "chrf+": 9.047271841257201, "chrf++": 7.916362861100051}}, {"data": {"target": "http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Parthood", "target_description": {"comment": "A special kind of Situation that allows to include time indexing for the hasPart relation in situations.

More theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.). Here no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time. If a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.  (1) Alternative aspectual views  Consider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one).  In the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).  The different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox?  A typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude. An alternative solution is suggested here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity.  For example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'. Consider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.  (2) Alternative intentionality views  Similarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces. Also in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event.  On the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it.  Therefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.  (3) Alternative participant views  A slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them.  For example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change. Anyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).  Ultimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it.  Both positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which assist domain experts in representing a certain portion of reality according to their own assumptions and requirements.   For this reason, in this ontology version of DOLCE, both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions (the reason for the inclusion of the D&S framewrok in DOLCE), in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the model designer.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": ["Quality", "Event", "Object"], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": ["has participant a Object", "has time interval a Time interval", "involves agent a Agent", "is event included in a Situation"], "is range of": ["Situation includes event", "Agent is agent involved in", "Object is participant in", "Time interval is time interval of"], "subclass of": ["has participant some Object", "has time interval some Time interval", "has constituent only Event", "Entity", "has part only Event"], "superclass of": ["Event"]}, "label": "Event"}, {"comment": "A Concept that classifies an Event .

More theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.). Here no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time. If a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.  (1) Alternative aspectual views  Consider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one).  In the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).  The different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox?  A typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude. An alternative solution is suggested here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity.  For example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'. Consider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.  (2) Alternative intentionality views  Similarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces. Also in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event.  On the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it.  Therefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.  (3) Alternative participant views  A slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them.  For example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change. Anyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).  Ultimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it.  Both positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which assist domain experts in representing a certain portion of reality according to their own assumptions and requirements.   For this reason, in this ontology version of DOLCE, both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions (the reason for the inclusion of the D&S framewrok in DOLCE), in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the model designer.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": ["Quality", "Event", "Object"], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": ["has participant a Object", "has time interval a Time interval", "involves agent a Agent", "is event included in a Situation"], "is range of": ["Situation includes event", "Agent is agent involved in", "Object is participant in", "Time interval is time interval of"], "subclass of": ["has time interval some Time interval", "has participant some Object", "has constituent only Event", "Entity", "has part only Event"], "superclass of": ["Event"]}, "label": "Event"}]}, "output": "(e.g. a company, a government, a school, etc.)\n---\nowl:Class: Organization\nrdfs:subClassOf: has time interval some Time interval, has participant some Object, has constituent only Event, Entity, has part only Event, \nrdfs:domain: has participant a Object, has time interval a Time interval, involves agent a Agent, is event included in a Situation, \nrdfs:range: Situation includes event, Agent is", "metrics": {"rouge1": 0.07407407407407407, "rouge2": 0.0, "rougeL": 0.07407407407407407, "rougeLsum": 0.07407407407407407, "meteor": 0.15254237288135597, "bertscore_precision": 0.7753894329071045, "bertscore_recall": 0.8234384059906006, "bertscore_f1": 0.7986919283866882, "chrf": 22.75812554873413, "chrf+": 22.452954453612843, "chrf++": 19.64633514691124}}, {"data": {"target": "http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Right", "target_description": {"comment": "A legal position by which an Agent is entitled to obtain something from another Agent , under specified circumstances, through an enforcement explicited either in a Law, Contract , etc.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": [], "is range of": [], "subclass of": ["defines task min 1 Thing", "Description", "defines role min 2 Thing"], "superclass of": []}, "label": "Right"}, "references": ["http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Agent", "http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Process", "http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Theory"], "references_description": [{"comment": "Additional comment: a computational agent can be considered as a PhysicalAgent that realizes a certain class of algorithms (that can be considered as instances of InformationObject) that allow to obtain some behaviors that are considered typical of agents in general.

A collective agent can have roles that are also roles of those agents. For example, in sociology, a 'group action' is the situation in which a number of people (that result to be members of a collective) in a given area behave in a coordinated way in order to achieve a (often common) goal. The Agent in such a Situation is not single, but a CollectiveAgent (a Group).

More theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.). Here no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time. If a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.  (1) Alternative aspectual views  Consider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one).  In the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).  The different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox?  A typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude. An alternative solution is suggested here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity.  For example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'. Consider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.  (2) Alternative intentionality views  Similarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces. Also in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event.  On the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it.  Therefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.  (3) Alternative participant views  A slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them.  For example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change. Anyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).  Ultimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it.  Both positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which assist domain experts in representing a certain portion of reality according to their own assumptions and requirements.   For this reason, in this ontology version of DOLCE, both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions (the reason for the inclusion of the D&S framewrok in DOLCE), in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the model designer.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": ["Quality", "Event", "Object"], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": ["has participant a Object", "has time interval a Time interval", "involves agent a Agent", "is event included in a Situation"], "is range of": ["Situation includes event", "Agent is agent involved in", "Object is participant in", "Time interval is time interval of"], "subclass of": ["has time interval some Time interval", "has participant some Object", "has constituent only Event", "Entity", "has part only Event"], "superclass of": ["Event"]}, "label": "Event"}, "references": ["http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#SocialPerson", "http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Workflow", "http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Situation"], "references_description": [{"comment": "A SocialAgent that needs the existence of a specific NaturalPerson in order to act (but the lifetime of the NaturalPerson has only to overlap that of the SocialPerson).", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": [], "is range of": [], "subclass of": ["Social agent", "Person", "acts through exactly 1 Thing"], "superclass of": []}, "label": "Social person"}, {"comment": "A Plan that defines Role(s), Task(s), and a specific structure for tasks to be executed, usually supporting the work of an Organization", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": [], "is range of": [], "subclass of": ["defines task some Task", "defines role some Role", "Plan"], "superclass of": []}, "label": "Workflow"}, {"comment": "A view, consistent with ('satisfying') a Description, on a set of entities.

More theoretically, events can be classified in different ways, possibly based on 'aspect' (e.g. stative, continuous, accomplishement, achievement, etc.), on 'agentivity' (e.g. intentional, natural, etc.), or on 'typical participants' (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.). Here no special direction is taken, and the following explains why: events are related to observable situations, and they can have different views at a same time. If a position has to be suggested here anyway, the participant-based classification of events seems the most stable and appropriate for many modelling problems.  (1) Alternative aspectual views  Consider a same event 'rock erosion in the Sinni valley': it can be conceptualized as an accomplishment (what has brought a certain state to occur), as an achievement (the state resulting from a previous accomplishment), as a punctual event (if we collapse the time interval of the erosion into a time point), or as a transition (something that has changed from a state to a different one).  In the erosion case, we could therefore have good motivations to shift from one aspect to another: a) causation focus, b) effectual focus, c) historical condensation, d) transition (causality).  The different views refer to the same event, but are still different: how to live with this seeming paradox?  A typical solution e.g. in linguistics (cf. Levin's aspectual classes) and in DOLCE Full (cf. WonderWeb D18 axiomatization) is to classify events based on aspectual differences. But this solution would create different identities for a same event, where the difference is only based on the modeller's attitude. An alternative solution is suggested here, and exploits the notion of (observable) Situation; a Situation is a view, consistent with a Description, which can be observed of a set of entities. It can also be seen as a 'relational context' created by an observer on the basis of a 'frame'. Therefore, a Situation allows to create a context where each particular view can have a proper identity, while the Event preserves its own identity.  For example, ErosionAsAccomplishment is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as a process leading to a certain achievement: the conditions (roles, parameters) that suggest such view are stated in a Description, which acts as a 'theory of accomplishments'. Similarly, ErosionAsTransition is a Situation where rock erosion is observed as an event that has changed a state to another: the conditions for such interpretation are stated in a different Description, which acts as a 'theory of state transitions'. Consider that in no case the actual event is changed or enriched in parts by the aspectual view.  (2) Alternative intentionality views  Similarly to aspectual views, several intentionality views can be provided for a same Event. For example, one can investigate if an avalanche has been caused by immediate natural forces, or if there is any hint of an intentional effort to activate those natural forces. Also in this case, the Event as such has not different identities, while the causal analysis generates situations with different identities, according to what Description is taken for interpreting the Event.  On the other hand, if the possible actions of an Agent causing the starting of an avalanche are taken as parts of the Event, then this makes its identity change, because we are adding a part to it.  Therefore, if intentionality is a criterion to classify events or not, this depends on if an ontology designer wants to consider causality as a relevant dimension for events' identity.  (3) Alternative participant views  A slightly different case is when we consider the basic participants to an Event. In this case, the identity of the Event is affected by the participating objects, because it depends on them.  For example, if snow, mountain slopes, wind, waves, etc. are considered as an avalanche basic participants, or if we also want to add water, human agents, etc., that makes the identity of an avalanche change. Anyway, this approach to event classification is based on the designer's choices, and more accurately mirrors lexical or commonsense classifications (see. e.g. WordNet 'supersenses' for verb synsets).  Ultimately, this discussion has no end, because realists will keep defending the idea that events in reality are not changed by the way we describe them, while constructivists will keep defending the idea that, whatever 'true reality' is about, it can't be modelled without the theoretical burden of how we observe and describe it.  Both positions are in principle valid, but, if taken too radically, they focus on issues that are only partly relevant to the aim of computational ontologies, which assist domain experts in representing a certain portion of reality according to their own assumptions and requirements.   For this reason, in this ontology version of DOLCE, both events and situations are allowed, together with descriptions (the reason for the inclusion of the D&S framewrok in DOLCE), in order to encode the modelling needs, independently from the position (if any) chosen by the model designer.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": ["Quality", "Event", "Object"], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": ["has participant a Object", "has time interval a Time interval", "involves agent a Agent", "is event included in a Situation"], "is range of": ["Situation includes event", "Agent is agent involved in", "Object is participant in", "Time interval is time interval of"], "subclass of": ["has time interval some Time interval", "has participant some Object", "has constituent only Event", "Entity", "has part only Event"], "superclass of": ["Event"]}, "label": "Event"}, {"comment": "Anything: real, possible, or imaginary, which some modeller wants to talk about for some purpose.", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": ["directly follows a Entity", "directly precedes a Entity", "far from a Entity", "follows a Entity", "has common boundary a Entity", "has component a Entity", "has constituent a Entity", "has constraint a Parameter", "has location a Entity", "has part a Entity", "has quality a Quality", "has region a Region", "has setting a Situation", "is classified by a Concept", "is component of a Entity", "is constituent of a Entity", "is described by a Description", "is location of a Entity", "is member of a Collection", "is observable at a Time interval", "is part of a Entity", "is reference of a Information object", "is reference of information realized by a Information realization", "near to a Entity", "overlaps a Entity", "precedes a Entity", "is in the same setting as a Entity"], "is range of": ["Concept classifies", "Description describes", "Entity directly follows", "Entity directly precedes", "Entity far from", "Entity follows", "Entity has common boundary", "Entity has component", "Entity has constituent", "Entity has location", "Collection has member", "Entity has part", "Information object is about", "Entity is component of", "Entity is constituent of", "Parameter is constraint for", "Entity is location of", "Entity is part of", "Quality is quality of", "Region is region for", "Situation is setting for", "Time interval is time of observation of", "Entity near to", "Entity overlaps", "Entity precedes", "Information realization realizes information about", "Entity is in the same setting as"], "subclass of": [], "superclass of": ["Entity"]}, "label": "Entity"}, {"comment": "A Plan that defines Role(s), Task(s), and a specific structure for tasks to be executed, usually supporting the work of an Organization", "facts": {"disjoint union of": [], "disjoint with": [], "equivalent to": [], "is domain of": [], "is range of": [], "subclass of": ["defines task some Task", "defines role some Role", "Plan"], "superclass of": []}, "label": "Workflow"}]}, "output": "rdfs:subClassOf: \nrdfs:domain: \nrdfs:range: \nrdfs:comment: \nrdfs:subClassOf: \nrdfs:domain: \nrdfs:range: \nrdfs:comment: \nrdfs:domain: \nrdfs:range: \nrdfs:comment: \nrdfs:domain: \nrdfs:range: \nrdfs:comment", "metrics": {"rouge1": 0.0, "rouge2": 0.0, "rougeL": 0.0, "rougeLsum": 0.0, "meteor": 0.0039936102236421715, "bertscore_precision": 0.7163910865783691, "bertscore_recall": 0.7706549763679504, "bertscore_f1": 0.7425329685211182, "chrf": 6.68637459680167, "chrf+": 5.858835756872334, "chrf++": 5.126481287263291}}, {"data": {"target": "http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/ont/dul/DUL.owl#Collective", "target_description": {"comment": "A Collection whose members are agents, e.g. \"the nurses\", \"the Italian rockabilly fans\".
