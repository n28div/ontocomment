I want you to act as an ontology design tutor. I will provide you with classes of an ontology and information about them and you will generate a comment of the class. Here are some examples of classes and their comments:
{% for d in references %}
class: {{ d.label }}
comment: {{ d.comment }}
---
{% endfor %}
class: {{ target.label }}
comment:
