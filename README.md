# Ontocomment

This repository contains the implementation and resources associated with the paper *Using LLMs to comment ontology classes*. 
The paper introduces a novel method for generating comments on classes of an OWL ontology without the need for human supervision. The approach involves a two-step process, where class descriptions are synthesized by verbalizing their axioms, followed by converting the verbalized class into a natural language sentence using Large Language Models. The resulting comments are then evaluated against real comments using standard Natural Language Processing metrics.
